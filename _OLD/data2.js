            "content": "<p></p><em>The Devil&#8217;s Dictionary</em> was begun in a weekly paper in 1881, and was continued in a desultory way at long intervals until 1906. In that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title <em>The Cynic&#8217;s Word Book</em>, a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve. To quote the publishers of the present work:</p><p><q>This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared, with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the country already had been flooded by its imitators with a score of &#8216;cynic&#8217; books&mdash;<em>The Cynic&#8217;s This</em>, <em>The Cynic&#8217;s That</em>, and <em>The Cynic&#8217;s t&#8217;Other</em>. Most of these books were merely stupid, though some of them added the distinction of silliness. Among them, they brought the word &#8216;cynic&#8217; into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication.</q></p><p>Meantime, too, some of the enterprising humorists of the country had helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs, and many of its definitions, anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had become more or less current in popular speech. This explanation is made, not with any pride of priority in trifles, but in simple denial of possible charges of plagiarism, which is no trifle. In merely resuming his own the author hopes to be held guiltless by those to whom the work is addressed&mdash;enlightened souls who prefer dry wines to sweet, sense to sentiment, wit to humor and clean English to slang. </p><p>A conspicuous, and it is hoped not unpleasant, feature of the book is its abundant illustrative quotations from eminent poets, chief of whom is that learned and ingenius cleric, Father Gassalasca Jape, S.J.,whose lines bear his initials. To Father Jape&#8217;s kindly encouragement and assistance the author of the prose text is greatly indebted. </p><p>A.B.</p>

The sight greatly staggered him, and he was so affected that his account of it was incoherent. In the year 1807 a troop of fairies visited a wood near Aix and carried off the daughter of a peasant, who had been seen to enter it with a bundle of clothing. The son of a wealthy </p><em>bourgeois</em> disappeared about the same time, but afterward returned. He had seen the abduction been in pursuit of the fairies. Justinian Gaux, a writer of the fourteenth century, avers that so great is the fairies&#8217; power of transformation that he saw one change itself into two opposing armies and fight a battle with great slaughter, and that the next day, after it had resumed its original shape and gone away, there were seven hundred bodies of the slain which the villagers had to bury. He does not say if any of the wounded recovered. In the time of Henry III, of England, a law was made which prescribed the death penalty for &#8220;Kyllynge, wowndynge, or mamynge&#8221; a fairy, and it was universally respected.

It is observed by Garvinus that the systems of punctuation in use by the various literary nations depended originally upon the social habits and general diet of the flies infesting the several countries. These creatures, which have always been distinguished for a neighborly and companionable familiarity with authors, liberally or niggardly embellish the manuscripts in process of growth under the pen, according to their bodily habit, bringing out the sense of the work by a species of interpretation superior to, and independent of, the writer&#8217;s powers. The &#8220;old masters&#8221; of literature&mdash;that is to say, the early writers whose work is so esteemed by later scribes and critics in the same language&mdash;never punctuated at all, but worked right along free-handed, without that abruption of the thought which comes from the use of points. (We observe the same thing in children to-day, whose usage in this particular is a striking and beautiful instance of the law that the infancy of individuals reproduces the methods and stages of development characterizing the infancy of races.) In the work of these primitive scribes all the punctuation is found, by the modern investigator with his optical instruments and chemical tests, to have been inserted by the writers&#8217; ingenious and serviceable collaborator, the common house-fly&mdash;</p><em>Musca maledicta</em>. In transcribing these ancient MSS, for the purpose of either making the work their own or preserving what they naturally regard as divine revelations, later writers reverently and accurately copy whatever marks they find upon the papyrus or parchment, to the unspeakable enhancement of the lucidity of the thought and value of the work. Writers contemporary with the copyists naturally avail themselves of the obvious advantages of these marks in their own work, and with such assistance as the flies of their own household may be willing to grant, frequently rival and sometimes surpass the older compositions, in respect at least of punctuation, which is no small glory. Fully to understand the important services that flies perform to literature it is only necessary to lay a page of some popular novelist alongside a saucer of cream-and-molasses in a sunny room and observe &#8220;how the wit brightens and the style refines&#8221; in accurate proportion to the duration of exposure.

The existence of ghouls has been disputed by that class of controversialists who are more concerned to deprive the world of comforting beliefs than to give it anything good in their place. In 1640 Father Secchi saw one in a cemetery near Florence and frightened it away with the sign of the cross. He describes it as gifted with many heads an an uncommon allowance of limbs, and he saw it in more than one place at a time. The good man was coming away from dinner at the time and explains that if he had not been &#8220;heavy with eating&#8221; he would have seized the demon at all hazards. Atholston relates that a ghoul was caught by some sturdy peasants in a churchyard at Sudbury and ducked in a horsepond. (He appears to think that so distinguished a criminal should have been ducked in a tank of rosewater.) The water turned at once to blood &#8220;and so contynues unto ys daye.&#8221; The pond has since been bled with a ditch. As late as the beginning of the fourteenth century a ghoul was cornered in the crypt of the cathedral at Amiens and the whole population surrounded the place. Twenty armed men with a priest at their head, bearing a crucifix, entered and captured the ghoul, which, thinking to escape by the stratagem, had transformed itself to the semblance of a well known citizen, but was nevertheless hanged, drawn and quartered in the midst of hideous popular orgies. The citizen whose shape the demon had assumed was so affected by the sinister occurrence that he never again showed himself in Amiens and his fate remains a mystery.

One day, several years ago, a rogue imperfectly reverent of the Secretary&#8217;s profound attainments and personal character presented him with a sack of gunpowder, representing it as the sed of the <em>Flashawful flabbergastor</em>, a Patagonian cereal of great commercial value, admirably adapted to this climate. The good Secretary was instructed to spill it along in a furrow and afterward inhume it with soil. This he at once proceeded to do, and had made a continuous line of it all the way across a ten-acre field, when he was made to look backward by a shout from the generous donor, who at once dropped a lighted match into the furrow at the starting-point. Contact with the earth had somewhat dampened the powder, but the startled functionary saw himself pursued by a tall moving pillar of fire and smoke and fierce evolution. He stood for a moment paralyzed and speechless, then he recollected an engagement and, dropping all, absented himself thence with such surprising celerity that to the eyes of spectators along the route selected he appeared like a long, dim streak prolonging itself with inconceivable rapidity through seven villages, and audibly refusing to be comforted. &#8220;Great Scott! what is that?&#8221; cried a surveyor&#8217;s chainman, shading his eyes and gazing at the fading line of agriculturist which bisected his visible horizon. &#8220;That,&#8221; said the surveyor, carelessly glancing at the phenomenon and again centering his attention upon his instrument, &#8220;is the Meridian of Washington.&#8221;</p>

They have apparently been compelled to give up the custom and account of the foulness of the brooks. Sotus Ecobius discovered in Central Asia a whole nation of people who hibernate. By some investigators, the fasting of Lent is supposed to have been originally a modified form of hibernation, to which the Church gave a religious significance; but this view was strenuously opposed by that eminent authority, Bishop Kip, who did not wish any honors denied to the memory of the Founder of his family.

To the person in actual experience of impalement it must be a matter of minor importance by what kind of civil or religious dissent he was made acquainted with its discomforts; but doubtless he would feel a certain satisfaction if able to contemplate himself in the character of a weather-cock on the spire of the True Church.

Nothing in any existing court was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and sorcery for which so many suffered death. If there were no witches, human testimony and human reason are alike destitute of value.</p>

The narrative ended abruptly at the point, owing to the inconsiderate crowing of a cock, which compelled the ghosted King of Men to scamper back to Hades. There is a fine mediaeval flavor to this story, and as it has not been traced back further than Pere Brateille, a pious but obscure writer at the court of Saint Louis, we shall probably not err on the side of presumption in considering it apocryphal, though Monsignor Capel&#8217;s judgment of the matter might be different; and to that I bow&mdash;wow.

Enraged all the more by this mischance, he commanded that the ungrateful courtier be thrown into prison, and that the glass be repaired and taken back to his own palace; and this was done. But when the king looked again on the mirror he saw not his image as before, but only the figure of a crowned ass, having a bloody bandage on one of its hinder hooves&mdash;as the artificers and all who had looked upon it had before discerned but feared to report. Taught wisdom and charity, the king restored his courtier to liberty, had the mirror set into the back of the throne and reigned many years with justice and humility; and one day when he fell asleep in death while on the throne, the whole court saw in the mirror the luminous figure of an angel, which remains to this day.</p>

And is it not now 3:10?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Son of a thousand illustrious deities,&#8221; answered the condemned minister, &#8220;all that you say is so true that the truth is a lie in comparison. But your heavenly Majesty&#8217;s sunny and vitalizing wishes have been pestilently disregarded. With joy I ran and placed my unworthy body in the market-place. The executioner appeared with his bare scimetar, ostentatiously whirled it in air, and then, tapping me lightly upon the neck, strode away, pelted by the populace, with whom I was ever a favorite. I am come to pray for justice upon his own dishonorable and treasonous head.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;To what regiment of executioners does the black-boweled caitiff belong?&#8221; asked the Mikado.</p> <p>&#8220;To the gallant Ninety-eight Hundred and Thirty-seventh&mdash;I know the man. His name is Sakko-Samshi.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Let him be brought before me,&#8221; said the Mikado to an attendant, and a half-hour later the culprit stood in the Presence.</p> <p>&#8220;Thou bastard son of a three-legged hunchback without thumbs!&#8221; roared the sovereign&mdash;&#8220;why didst thou but lightly tap the neck that it should have been thy pleasure to sever?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Lord of Cranes of Cherry Blooms,&#8221; replied the executioner, unmoved, &#8220;command him to blow his nose with his fingers.&#8221;</p> <p>Being commanded, Jijiji Ri laid hold of his nose and trumpeted like an elephant, all expecting to see the severed head flung violently from him. Nothing occurred: the performance prospered peacefully to the close, without incident.</p> <p>All eyes were now turned on the executioner, who had grown as white as the snows on the summit of Fujiama. His legs trembled and his breath came in gasps of terror.</p> <p>&#8220;Several kinds of spike-tailed brass lions!&#8221; he cried; &#8220;I am a ruined and disgraced swordsman! I struck the villain feebly because in flourishing the scimetar I had accidentally passed it through my own neck! Father of the Moon, I resign my office.&#8221;</p> <p>So saying, he gasped his top-knot, lifted off his head, and advancing to the throne laid it humbly at the Mikado&#8217;s feet.</p> </p></blockquote>

In the British museum are preserved many ancient papers, mostly of a sacerdotal character, validated by necromantic pentagrams and other devices, frequently initial letters of words to conjure with; and in many instances these are attached in the same way that seals are appended now. As nearly every reasonless and apparently meaningless custom, rite or observance of modern times had origin in some remote utility, it is pleasing to note an example of ancient nonsense evolving in the process of ages into something really useful. Our word &#8220;sincere&#8221; is derived from </p><em>sine cero</em>, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S.,commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean <em>locum sigillis</em>, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used &mdash;an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words <em>locum sigillis</em> are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.

Plato held that those souls which in a previous state of existence (antedating Athens) had obtained the clearest glimpses of eternal truth entered into the bodies of persons who became philosophers. Plato himself was a philosopher. The souls that had least contemplated divine truth animated the bodies of usurpers and despots. Dionysius I, who had threatened to decapitate the broad-browed philosopher, was a usurper and a despot. Plato, doubtless, was not the first to construct a system of philosophy that could be quoted against his enemies; certainly he was not the last.</p><p>&#8220;Concerning the nature of the soul,&#8221; saith the renowned author of <em>Diversiones Sanctorum</em>, &#8220;there hath been hardly more argument than that of its place in the body. Mine own belief is that the soul hath her seat in the abdomen&mdash;in which faith we may discern and interpret a truth hitherto unintelligible, namely that the glutton is of all men most devout. He is said in the Scripture to &#8216;make a god of his belly&#8217; &mdash;why, then, should he not be pious, having ever his Deity with him to freshen his faith? Who so well as he can know the might and majesty that he shrines? Truly and soberly, the soul and the stomach are one Divine Entity; and such was the belief of Promasius, who nevertheless erred in denying it immortality. He had observed that its visible and material substance failed and decayed with the rest of the body after death, but of its immaterial essence he knew nothing. This is what we call the Appetite, and it survives the wreck and reek of mortality, to be rewarded or punished in another world, according to what it hath demanded in the flesh. The Appetite whose coarse clamoring was for the unwholesome viands of the general market and the public refectory shall be cast into eternal famine, whilst that which firmly through civilly insisted on ortolans, caviare, terrapin, anchovies, <em>pates de foie gras</em> and all such Christian comestibles shall flesh its spiritual tooth in the souls of them forever and ever, and wreak its divine thirst upon the immortal parts of the rarest and richest wines ever quaffed here below. Such is my religious faith, though I grieve to confess that neither His Holiness the Pope nor His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury (whom I equally and profoundly revere) will assent to its dissemination.&#8221;</p>

The truth of the stories here following has, however, not been successfully impeached.</p><p>One evening Mr. Rudolph Block, of New York, found himself seated at dinner alongside Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.</p><p>&#8220;Mr. Pollard,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my book, <em>The Biography of a Dead Cow</em>, is published anonymously, but you can hardly be ignorant of its authorship.

Do you think that fair criticism?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I am very sorry, sir,&#8221; replied the critic, amiably, &#8220;but it did not occur to me that you really might not wish the public to know who wrote it.&#8221;</p><p>Mr. W.C. Morrow, who used to live in San Jose, California, was addicted to writing ghost stories which made the reader feel as if a stream of lizards, fresh from the ice, were streaking it up his back and hiding in his hair. San Jose was at that time believed to be haunted by the visible spirit of a noted bandit named Vasquez, who had been hanged there. The town was not very well lighted, and it is putting it mildly to say that San Jose was reluctant to be out o&#8217; nights. One particularly dark night two gentlemen were abroad in the loneliest spot within the city limits, talking loudly to keep up their courage, when they came upon Mr. J.J. Owen, a well-known journalist.</p><p>&#8220;Why, Owen,&#8221; said one, &#8220;what brings you here on such a night as this? You told me that this is one of Vasquez&#8217; favorite haunts! And you are a believer. Aren&#8217;t you afraid to be out?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;My dear fellow,&#8221; the journalist replied with a drear autumnal cadence in his speech, like the moan of a leaf-laden wind, &#8220;I am afraid to be in. I have one of Will Morrow&#8217;s stories in my pocket and I don&#8217;t dare to go where there is light enough to read it.&#8221;</p><p>Rear-Admiral Schley and Representative Charles F. Joy were standing near the Peace Monument, in Washington, discussing the question, Is success a failure? Mr. Joy suddenly broke off in the middle of an eloquent sentence, exclaiming: &#8220;Hello! I&#8217;ve heard that band before. Santlemann&#8217;s, I think.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hear any band,&#8221; said Schley.</p><p>&#8220;Come to think, I don&#8217;t either,&#8221; said Joy; &#8220;but I see General Miles coming down the avenue, and that pageant always affects me in the same way as a brass band. One has to scrutinize one&#8217;s impressions pretty closely, or one will mistake their origin.&#8221;</p><p>While the Admiral was digesting this hasty meal of philosophy General Miles passed in review, a spectacle of impressive dignity. When the tail of the seeming procession had passed and the two observers had recovered from the transient blindness caused by its effulgence&mdash;</p><p>&#8220;He seems to be enjoying himself,&#8221; said the Admiral.</p><p>&#8220;There is nothing,&#8221; assented Joy, thoughtfully, &#8220;that he enjoys one-half so well.&#8221;</p><p>The illustrious statesman, Champ Clark, once lived about a mile from the village of Jebigue, in Missouri. One day he rode into town on a favorite mule, and, hitching the beast on the sunny side of a street, in front of a saloon, he went inside in his character of teetotaler, to apprise the barkeeper that wine is a mocker. It was a dreadfully hot day. Pretty soon a neighbor came in and seeing Clark, said:</p><p>&#8220;Champ, it is not right to leave that mule out there in the sun. He&#8217;ll roast, sure!&mdash;he was smoking as I passed him.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;O, he&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Clark, lightly; &#8220;he&#8217;s an inveterate smoker.&#8221;</p><p>The neighbor took a lemonade, but shook his head and repeated that it was not right.</p><p>He was a conspirator. There had been a fire the night before: a stable just around the corner had burned and a number of horses had put on their immortality, among them a young colt, which was roasted to a rich nut-brown. Some of the boys had turned Mr. Clark&#8217;s mule loose and substituted the mortal part of the colt. Presently another man entered the saloon.</p><p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake!&#8221; he said, taking it with sugar, &#8220;do remove that mule, barkeeper: it smells.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; interposed Clark, &#8220;that animal has the best nose in Missouri. But if he doesn&#8217;t mind, you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><p>In the course of human events Mr. Clark went out, and there, apparently, lay the incinerated and shrunken remains of his charger. The boys did not have any fun out of Mr. Clarke, who looked at the body and, with the non-committal expression to which he owes so much of his political preferment, went away. But walking home late that night he saw his mule standing silent and solemn by the wayside in the misty moonlight. Mentioning the name of Helen Blazes with uncommon emphasis, Mr. Clark took the back track as hard as ever he could hook it, and passed the night in town.</p><p>General H.H. Wotherspoon, president of the Army War College, has a pet rib-nosed baboon, an animal of uncommon intelligence but imperfectly beautiful. Returning to his apartment one evening, the General was surprised and pained to find Adam (for so the creature is named, the general being a Darwinian) sitting up for him and wearing his master&#8217;s best uniform coat, epaulettes and all.</p><p>&#8220;You confounded remote ancestor!&#8221; thundered the great strategist, &#8220;what do you mean by being out of bed after naps?&mdash;and with my coat on!&#8221;</p><p>Adam rose and with a reproachful look got down on all fours in the manner of his kind and, scuffling across the room to a table, returned with a visiting-card: General Barry had called and, judging by an empty champagne bottle and several cigar-stumps, had been hospitably entertained while waiting. The general apologized to his faithful progenitor and retired. The next day he met General Barry, who said:</p><p>&#8220;Spoon, old man, when leaving you last evening I forgot to ask you about those excellent cigars. Where did you get them?&#8221;</p><p>General Wotherspoon did not deign to reply, but walked away.</p><p>&#8220;Pardon me, please,&#8221; said Barry, moving after him; &#8220;I was joking of course. Why, I knew it was not you before I had been in the room fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p>

To be absolutely wise and good&mdash;that is perfection; and the Theosophist is so keen-sighted as to have observed that everything desirous of improvement eventually attains perfection. Less competent observers are disposed to except cats, which seem neither wiser nor better than they were last year.

It was Miss Hall&#8217;s belief that nature had not endowed Miss Russell with beautiful legs. This theory was impossible of acceptance by the male understanding, but the conception of a faulty female leg was of so prodigious originality as to rank among the most brilliant feats of philosophical speculation! It is strange that in all the controversy regarding Miss Russell&#8217;s aversion to tights no one seems to have thought to ascribe it to what was known among the ancients as &#8220;modesty.&#8221; The nature of that sentiment is now imperfectly understood, and possibly incapable of exposition with the vocabulary that remains to us.

In our day the accused is usually a human being, or a socialist, but in mediaeval times, animals, fishes, reptiles and insects were brought to trial. A beast that had taken human life, or practiced sorcery, was duly arrested, tried and, if condemned, put to death by the public executioner. Insects ravaging grain fields, orchards or vineyards were cited to appeal by counsel before a civil tribunal, and after testimony, argument and condemnation, if they continued </p><em>in contumaciam</em> the matter was taken to a high ecclesiastical court, where they were solemnly excommunicated and anathematized.

Let us have a little less of &#8220;hands across the sea,&#8221; and a little more of that elemental distrust that is the security of nations. War loves to come like a thief in the night; professions of eternal amity provide the night.</p>
